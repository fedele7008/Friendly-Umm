# Scanner (Lexical analyzer)

Scanner is crucial component on the compiler. It serves as the gateway to transforming raw source code (FriendlyUmm) into meaningful Tokens.

It is very first step of compilation process and is responsible for breaking down the code into its fundamental building blocks (i.e. Token).

For more information about how Scanner works, please refer to the documentation, `doc/`.
